# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

ENV Setup
```
npm install dotenv
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```

Deploy to Amoy
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network amoy
```
